# calc-proj
Your project is to create a **Command Line Calculator**

##Requirements
* Your program should present a list of calculations that your program can do
* You need at least five operations
    * Such as: addition, subtraction, division, multiplication
        * *You must use functions for each of these operations!*
* Each operation should take the appropriate amount of inputs
    * For example: division should take exactly two numbers
    * For extra credit you can take as many inputs as the user would like for operations like addition and multiplication 
* To begin with, the program should run exactly one time (i.e. one operation)
    * *Time permitting* the user should be able to do as many operations as they would like until they choose to exit the program 
* You may create alternative operations â€” feel free to get creative 
    * e.g. pizza calculator that takes in number of people and hunger level

##Groups:
* Briana + Natalie
* Gaby, Came, Megan 

##A few reminders:
* Keep in mind the MVP (minimum viable product) 
    * At every stage of your program, I expect it to be able to function
    * Do NOT divide up all of the work and just expect it to all work at the end
* Come up with a clear plan in advance so that you know what you are trying to create 
* This project is meant to test your understanding of variables, user input, conditional logic, loops and functions 
    * Arrays and hashes might come in handy for the extra credit portions, but will not be particularly useful for the rest of the project
